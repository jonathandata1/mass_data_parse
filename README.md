![Mass Data Parse Extract All URLs](https://i.postimg.cc/TPRnRKqK/Untitled-design-Max-Quality-60.jpg)
### CURRENT VERSION 1.0

## This one line of code uses sort and uniq command built that is built right into macOS and Linux
> Sometimes when you are doing recon you have a lot of data that you pull down, or sometimes you download a giant file and you need to extract all the URLs from it. 

>Whatever the case may be you can extract any kind of data that you need faster than you have ever done before. 

>This script runs through nested directories so all you have to do is run it in the directory you want to parse data from.

```
brew install sfk

sudo apt install pup

### The cool timer is python - but not needed 
```
pip3 install termdown
```
